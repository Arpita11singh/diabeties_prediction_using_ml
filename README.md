Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning Diabetes

Overview This repository contains code and resources for a Machine Learning project aimed at predicting diabetes using relevant health and lifestyle features. Diabetes is a widespread chronic disease, and early prediction can help in its effective management. This project showcases the implementation of various machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on input features such as glucose levels, BMI, age, etc.

Table of Contents Project Description Installation Usage Data Models Evaluation Contributing License Project Description In this project, we use a dataset containing relevant health and lifestyle attributes to predict the probability of an individual having diabetes. We explore various machine learning techniques, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, to create predictive models. The goal is to provide a tool that can assist healthcare professionals and individuals in identifying potential cases of diabetes.

Installation To run this project on your local machine, you need to have Python and the necessary libraries installed. You can set up your environment by following these steps:

Clone this repository:

bash Copy code git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes_prediction_using_ml.git Install the required Python packages:

Copy code pip install -r requirements.txt Usage You can use the provided Jupyter notebooks to understand the data, train machine learning models, and make predictions. Start by exploring the notebooks in the notebooks directory. Here's a brief overview of the main files:

data_preparation.ipynb: Data preprocessing and exploration. model_training.ipynb: Training different machine learning models. prediction.ipynb: Making predictions using the trained models. Data The dataset used for this project can be found in the data directory. It contains features such as glucose levels, BMI, age, and the target variable indicating diabetes status.

Models We have implemented and trained several machine learning models in the models directory. You can find serialized models as well as the code to train and evaluate them.

Evaluation We evaluate the models using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. You can find the evaluation results in the respective notebook (model_training.ipynb).
